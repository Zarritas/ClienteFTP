This is the Linux port of Sun(tm)'s Java(tm) Development Kit 1.0.2.

THESE FILES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL SUN(tm) VERSIONS AND
THEY CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS.

There, with that done, lets go on =)

You will need two files to form a complete copy of this package.  Both
can be obtained from one of the mirrors listed at
ftp://java.blackdown.org/pub/Java/linux.

linux.jdk-1.0.2-pl1.common.tar.gz -- Common files for both versions

and one of:
 linux.jdk-1.0.2-pl1.static-motif-bin.tar.gz -- binaries for those without
                                          ELF libXm.so.2
      *OR*
 linux.jdk-1.0.2-pl1.shared-motif2-bin.tar.gz -- binaries for those with above.

libXm.so.2 is version 2.0 of the Motif library.  It is not free software.
If you do not have it, or do not know what it is, please get the
static-motif distribution.

YOU MUST HAVE ELF INSTALLED TO USE EITHER VERSION!  Please see the HOWTO
for more details.

Please unpack both files under /usr/local (if you place them elsewhere,
you will need to modify some of the scripts in java/bin).

There is a HOWTO included in this package.  Please refer to it for
questions before asking publicly.  It is also available off of
http://java.blackdown.org/java-linux.html

The source diffs for this port will be out shortly.  Please check the
web site above for more information.

Thank you,
